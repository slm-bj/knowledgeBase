* Feature Engineering for Machine Learning, by Alice Zheng, 2018:
  coding with pandas and scikit-learn,
  [code repo](https://github.com/alicezheng/feature-engineering-book).

* Feature Engineering Made Easy by Sinan Ozdemir, 2018: implemented with scikit-learn with Python 2.7,
  [code repo](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Feature-Engineering-Made-Easy).
  Pay attention to the section [Feature selection > The types of feature selection >
  Model based feature selection > Using machine learning to select features >
  Tree-based model feature selection metrics].

* Feature Engineering and Selection, A Practical Approach for Predictive Models,
  by Max Kuhn, 2019: plenty of images, theories and equations, no code implementation.

* Feature Engineering for Machine Learning and Data Analytics by Dong, Guozhu; Liu, Huan:
  a collection of research papers. Each chapter is an independent paper.
  No code implementation.
